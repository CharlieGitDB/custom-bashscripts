# custom-bashscripts

## This is a project for random bashscripts that I wrote that I find useful

#### To use gitstatusallprojects script:
1. Nano into .bashrc   
`nano ~/.bashrc`

2. Add an alias inside of the .bashrc file that you will use to call the gitstatusall script *replace the example folder path with your own*  
`alias gitstatusall="/Users/example/gitstatusallprojects.sh"`

3. Now you're able to go through a directory of projects and check the git status of the the projects in the directory
